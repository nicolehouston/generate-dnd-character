# Description

This project uses OpenAI's art generator (Dall-E) api to create a profile picture of a DnD character given certain attributes. This project is still in progress.

## Tech

- React
- Javascript
- OpenAI (Dall-E)

## What I learned

There are a lot of ai art generators out there. After experimenting with a couple I went with OpenAI and Dall-E because of the ease of use, the amount of time it took to generate the picture, the quality of the picture, and the price.
